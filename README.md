# Tickets-2022
Repository to hold all of my processing tickets for ADC for the year 2022.

Internal folders of the repository correspond to last name of researcher who's ticket/dataset is being processed. Data will not be added to this repository. However, once datasets have been made public on the [Arctic Data Center](arcticdata.io) website, the data can be downloaded from there. 

Setting up this repository also serves the purpose of being able to create issues and track tasks specific to certain tickets in one central location for myself, rather than on my delightful mess of sticky notes ðŸŸ¨
